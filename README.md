# The problem of philosphers, forks and food.

The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.
- While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;
- while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
- while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking

The program deals with Threads and mutexes. The idea is to have a sustaining cycle of eating, sleeping and thinking by threads( aka philos) while protecting the shared variables with mutexes.
